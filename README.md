# Clams Eval Server
This is the evalution server for the Clams project.
It uses the availability model proposed by Rodrigues.

Because of a mistake in the Rodrigues Boiler Control System do the following:
In the [Coposer.ts](https://github.com/ProbstenHias/eval-server-template/blob/master/src/factories/Composer.ts) file there are two different if clauses.
If you want to use the Boiler Control System to check the result of the paper the comment out the line 111.
If you want to use every other cloud model, then comment out line 109.

The Boiler Control System can be found in the Boiler.json file.
